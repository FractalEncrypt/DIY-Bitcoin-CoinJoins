PSBT Workflow
##1. Createpsbt
##Get 4 new addresses. Copy/paste this command 4 times
getnewaddress "" "bech32"

createpsbt \
'[{"txid": "txid1", "vout": vout1},
{"txid": "txid2", "vout": vout2},
{"txid": "txid3", "vout": vout3},
{"txid": "txid4", "vout": vout4}]' \
'{"address1": CoinJoinAmount,
"address2": CoinJoinAmount,
"address3": CoinJoinAmount,
"address4": CoinJoinAmount}'

##Place raw hex of pbst for above tx below

##Decodepsbt and double check 

###PSBT_2
##Get 4 new addresses. Copy/paste this command 4 times
getnewaddress "" "bech32"

createpsbt \
'[{"txid": "txid1", "vout": vout1},
{"txid": "txid2", "vout": vout2},
{"txid": "txid3", "vout": vout3},
{"txid": "txid4", "vout": vout4}]' \
'{"address1": CoinJoinAmount,
"address2": CoinJoinAmount,
"address3": CoinJoinAmount,
"address4": CoinJoinAmount}'


##Place raw hex of pbst for above tx below

##2. Have individual users send their PSBTs to coordinator
##3. Coordinator uses joinpsbts to join the separate PSBTs into one
joinpsbts '["",""]'
joinpsbts '["",""]'

##3a. Decodepsbt and double check fees (all the way at the bottom), if fees are too high, you messed something up
##4. Coordinator sends the joined PSBT back to each user to sign with walletprocesspsbt
walletprocesspsbt psbt_raw_hex

##walletprocessedpsbt from Wallet 1

##walletprocessedpsbt from Wallet 2


##5. Once all users have signed/processed the joined PSBT, coordinator uses combinepsbt.
combinepsbt '["",""]'
combinepsbt '["",""]'

This returns a CombinedPSBT_rawHex

##5a. Decode the PSBT to make sure everything is correct
Decodepsbt CombinedPSBT_rawHex

##6. Coordinator uses finalizepsbt and then transmits to the network using sendrawtransaction.
finalizepsbt psbt_raw_hex

##7 This outputs the raw transaction hex
sendrawtransaction Raw_Tx-Hex
