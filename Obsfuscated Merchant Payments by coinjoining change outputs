Obsfuscated Merchant Payments by coinjoining "change outputs"

When making payment to a merchant, create the transaction so that;
 1. You can double the payment amount so you can have 2 equal outputs
  a. This would likely result in the need to create a change address
     This change should be divided in 2 equal outputs, so the transaction has
     the payment, a matching amount output, and a pair of change outputs
  
 2. Simply make the payment, and then any change from the UTXOs should be divided
    into 2 or 3 equal output amounts
 
 3. use the chance to consolidate some UTXOs if needed, and create smaller, but still paired equal output amounts
