Obsfuscated Merchant Payments by coinjoining "change outputs"

When making payment to a merchant, create the transaction so that;
 1. You can double the payment amount to you can have 2 equal outputs
  a. This would likely result in the need to create a change address
     This change should be divided in 2 equal outputs, so the transaction has
     the payment, a matching amount output, and a pair of change outputs
  
 2. Simply make the payment, and then any change from the UTXOs should be divided
    into 2 or 3 equal output amounts
 
 3. Use the chance to consolidate multiple UTXOs if needed, and create smaller, but still paired equal output amounts
 - For example say the user has 1 BTC available across multiple UTXOs that s/he would like to consolidate.
  - User needs to make a merchant payment of 0.2 BTC
  - User can combine all UTXOs as transaction inputs equaling 1 BTC
  - User can create 5 equal outputs of 0.2 BTC, one of these goes directly to the merchant in this transaction, 
  the other four outputs of 0.2 BTC go to new unused BTC addresses all controlled by the user.
