##Take the Merchant's bitcoin address and paste it into MerchantAddress
##Take the amount of the merchant payment and place in CoinJoinAmount1
##run listunspent and review UTXOs to see what can be used to create the CoinJoin transaction
##Add the value of 2 UTXOs and subtract a fee amount (500 sats for this example)
##Place the txid and vouts into the transaction template
##Subtract CoinJoinAmount1 from UTXO value 2 or more times (we use 3 times for this example)
##Divide remainder by 2, Place this amount into CoinJoinAmount2
##(this is to CoinJoin any remaining change)  

##I'm using the Coingate testnet store for this example - https://example.coingate.com/

##CoinJoinAmount1 = C
##C x 3 = D
##UTXO1 + UTXO2 = E = 
##E-D = i = 
##i - feeAmount = Q = 
##Q/2 = CoinJoinAmount2
##CoinJoinAmount2 = 


##MerchantAmount = 
##MerchantAmount = CoinJoinAmount1
